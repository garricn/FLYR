#FLYR
Starting my passion project from scratch again, again.
Gonna try to submit it for Planet of the Apps.
Gonna practice Test Driven Functional Reactive MVVM.
Gonna try out the AppCoordinator pattern.
Using Bond for reactive
Using Quick & Nimble for testing
Using Cartography for auto layout
Might try Fox property based testing framework too.
